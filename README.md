Heart Attack Prediction Model

Overview

The Heart Attack Prediction Model is a machine learning-based system designed to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on various health parameters. It utilizes data preprocessing, feature selection, and classification algorithms to provide an accurate risk assessment.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outlier detection, and normalization.

Feature Engineering: Selection of relevant health parameters for accurate prediction.

Machine Learning Models: Implementation of classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM.

Model Evaluation: Performance assessment using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualization: Graphical representation of data trends and model predictions.

Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset containing medical attributes such as:

Age

Gender

Blood Pressure

Cholesterol Levels

Heart Rate

Diabetes History

Smoking Habits

Family History of Heart Disease

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/heart-attack-prediction.git
